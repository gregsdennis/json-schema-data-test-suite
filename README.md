This repository is intended as a host for test suites for various custom vocabularies.

(Mostly, I expect this will be for my vocabs, but I'm open to hosting test suites for vocabs from others.)

Currently supported: nothing... but there are a couple in the works.

- [data](https://json-everything.net/json-schema#a-vocabulary-for-accessing-data-stored-in-json)
- [uniqueItems](https://json-everything.net/json-schema#a-vocabulary-for-identifying-uniqueness-of-array-items)

## Using this suite

The tests are contained in the `/tests` folder.  Each vocabulary suite has its own subfolder.

The format and layout of each vocabulary suite follows the [official JSON Schema Test Suite](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite).

Individual vocab suites have a README that contains any additional information required to run that suite.

## Contributing

Questions and comments are welcome in issues, or you can connect to the [JSON Schema Slack](https://json-schema.org/slack) for a more real-time discussion.

PRs are welcome for new tests, fixes to existing tests, new vocab suites, etc.
